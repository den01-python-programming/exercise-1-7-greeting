# Exercise 1.7 - Greeting

Write a program that prompts the user for their name. When the user has written their name, the program has to print "Hi " followed by the user's name.

The exercise template comes with a program template that includes the function and its call.

```python
def main():
  #write your code below this line

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Example output when user gives the name Ada.

```plaintext
*Ada*
Hi Ada
```

Example output when user gives the name Lily.

```plaintext
*Lily*
Hi Lily
```
